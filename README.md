# conformal-predictor
Created during the 2024-2025 CS3020 module 'Machine Learing' at Royal Holloway University of London. The specification for the project was provided by University.

## Setup project
- Import Iris Dataset.
- Install scikit-learn.
- Install Numpy

## Desctription
This project estimate:
- Implemnt th Nearest Neighbour(k=1, k=3).
- genralization accuracy for K=1 and K=3.
- Implemment conformal-prediction to calucate the performance of the model(in this case calcualting the false p-values)
